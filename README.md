<h4> Getting and Cleaning Data course project</h4>

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

-Download the dataset in the working directory

-Unzip the dataset in the working directory

-Read the activity and feature info

-From the training and test datasets, keeping those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation only.

-From activity and subject data for each dataset and merges those columns with the dataset

-Merges these datasets

-Converts the activity and subject columns into factors

-Create a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity.

Finally we get the tidydata.txt
